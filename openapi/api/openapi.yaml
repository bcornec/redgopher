        RAID01: A data placement policy that creates a mirrored device (RAID 1) over a set of striped devices (RAID 0).
        RAID1: A placement policy where each logical block of data is stored on more than one independent storage device.
        RAID10: A placement policy that creates a striped device (RAID 0) over a set of mirrored devices (RAID 1).
        RAID10E: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more RAID 10 sets.
        RAID10Triple: A placement policy that uses a striped device (RAID 0) over a set of triple mirrored devices (RAID 1Triple).
        RAID1E: A placement policy that uses a form of mirroring implemented over a set of independent storage devices where logical blocks are duplicated on a pair of independent storage devices so that data is uniformly distributed across the storage devices.
        RAID1Triple: A placement policy where each logical block of data is mirrored three times across a set of three independent storage devices.
        RAID3: A placement policy using parity-based protection where logical bytes of data are uniformly distributed across a set of independent storage devices and where the parity is stored on a dedicated independent storage device.
        RAID4: A placement policy using parity-based protection where logical blocks of data are uniformly distributed across a set of independent storage devices and where the parity is stored on a dedicated independent storage device.
        RAID5: A placement policy using parity-based protection for storing stripes of 'n' logical blocks of data and one logical block of parity across a set of 'n+1' independent storage devices where the parity and data blocks are interleaved across the storage devices.
        RAID50: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more RAID 5 sets of independent storage devices.
        RAID6: A placement policy using parity-based protection for storing stripes of 'n' logical blocks of data and two logical blocks of independent parity across a set of 'n+2' independent storage devices where the parity and data blocks are interleaved across the storage devices.
        RAID60: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more RAID 6 sets of independent storage devices.
        RAID6TP: A placement policy that uses parity-based protection for storing stripes of 'n' logical blocks of data and three logical blocks of independent parity across a set of 'n+3' independent storage devices where the parity and data blocks are interleaved across the storage devices. This is commonly referred to as Triple Parity RAID. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive any three independent storage device failures without data loss.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        RAID0: A placement policy where consecutive logical blocks of data are uniformly distributed across a set of independent storage devices without offering any form of redundancy. This is commonly referred to as data striping. This form of RAID will encounter data loss with the failure of any storage device in the set.
        RAID00: A placement policy that creates a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more RAID 0 sets. This is commonly referred to as RAID 0+0. This form of data layout is not fault tolerant; if any storage device fails there will be data loss.
        RAID01: A data placement policy that creates a mirrored device (RAID 1) over a set of striped devices (RAID 0). This is commonly referred to as RAID 0+1 or RAID 0/1. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single RAID 0 data set failure without data loss.
        RAID1: A placement policy where each logical block of data is stored on more than one independent storage device. This is commonly referred to as mirroring. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage device failure without data loss.
        RAID10: A placement policy that creates a striped device (RAID 0) over a set of mirrored devices (RAID 1). This is commonly referred to as RAID 1/0. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive storage device failures in each RAID 1 set without data loss.
        RAID10E: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more RAID 10 sets. This is commonly referred to as Enhanced RAID 10. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single device failure within each nested RAID 1 set without data loss.
        RAID10Triple: 'A placement policy that uses a striped device (RAID 0) over
          a set of triple mirrored devices (RAID 1Triple). This form of RAID can survive
          up to two failures in each triple mirror set without data loss. '
        RAID1E: A placement policy that uses a form of mirroring implemented over a set of independent storage devices where logical blocks are duplicated on a pair of independent storage devices so that data is uniformly distributed across the storage devices. This is commonly referred to as RAID 1 Enhanced. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage device failure without data loss.
        RAID1Triple: A placement policy where each logical block of data is mirrored three times across a set of three independent storage devices. This is commonly referred to as three-way mirroring. This form of RAID can survive two device failures without data loss.
        RAID3: A placement policy using parity-based protection where logical bytes of data are uniformly distributed across a set of independent storage devices and where the parity is stored on a dedicated independent storage device. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage device failure without data loss. If the storage devices use rotating media, they are assumed to be rotationally synchronized, and the data stripe size should be no larger than the exported block size.
        RAID4: A placement policy using parity-based protection where logical blocks of data are uniformly distributed across a set of independent storage devices and where the parity is stored on a dedicated independent storage device. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage device failure without data loss.
        RAID5: A placement policy using parity-based protection for storing stripes of 'n' logical blocks of data and one logical block of parity across a set of 'n+1' independent storage devices where the parity and data blocks are interleaved across the storage devices. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage device failure without data loss.
        RAID50: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more RAID 5 sets of independent storage devices. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive a single storage device failure within each RAID 5 set without data loss.
        RAID6: A placement policy using parity-based protection for storing stripes of 'n' logical blocks of data and two logical blocks of independent parity across a set of 'n+2' independent storage devices where the parity and data blocks are interleaved across the storage devices. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive any two independent storage device failures without data loss.
        RAID60: A placement policy that uses a RAID 0 stripe set over two or more RAID 6 sets of independent storage devices. Data stored using this form of RAID is able to survive two device failures within each RAID 6 set without data loss.
